# Tidyverse Directory
Welcome to the Tidyverse directory in my Statistics and Probability for Data Science using R repository on Github!

## What is Tidyverse?
Tidyverse is a collection of R packages for data science that includes tools for data manipulation, visualization, and modeling. It is designed to work well with the "tidy data" framework, which emphasizes a consistent structure for data that makes it easier to work with.

You can learn more about Tidyverse on the official website: https://www.tidyverse.org/

## Lessons, Exercises, and Solutions
If you're interested in learning more about Tidyverse and how to use it for data science, you can check out the "R for Data Science" book, also known as "r4ds". This book is available online for free and provides a comprehensive guide to using Tidyverse and other R tools for data science.

You can find the book at the official r4ds website: https://r4ds.had.co.nz/

The website includes chapters on data visualization, data transformation, programming, and modeling with Tidyverse packages like ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, and purrr. The book also includes exercises and solutions to help you practice your skills.
