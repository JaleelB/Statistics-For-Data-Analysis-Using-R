# Descriptive Statistics Assignment


## Question 1: 
Create a vector with 10 random integers between 1 and 20. Calculate the range and IQR of the vector. Add an outlier to the vector and re-calculate the range and IQR. How does the outlier affect these measures of variation?

## Question 2:
Create a matrix with 3 rows and 4 columns filled with random integers between 1 and 10. Calculate the mean and standard deviation of each column. Which column has the highest standard deviation?

## Question 3
Create a vector of 10 random integers between 1 and 100. Calculate the median and mode of the vector. What does it mean if the median and mode are the same value?

## Question 4
Write a function in R to calculate the mean of a vector of numbers. Test the function using the vector c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5).

## Question 5
Calculate the median and mode of the following dataset using R: c(1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 8).

## Question 6
Use R to generate a vector of 100 random numbers between 1 and 100. Calculate the range and IQR of the vector.

## Question 7
Write a program in R that generates a list of 50 numbers, with a mean of 5 and a standard deviation of 1.

## Question 8
Use R to read a CSV file containing a dataset and store the dataset in a variable. Then, calculate the mean and median of a specific column in the dataset.
