# Data Directory
Welcome to the data directory of this repository. This directory serves to direct you to datasets to follow along when learning  "Statistics and Probability for Data Analysis Using R".

If you are interested in exploring and working with large datasets, I recommend checking out the Tidy Tuesday project repository. Tidy Tuesday is a weekly data project aimed at the R ecosystem. As the project was borne out of the R4DS Online Learning Community and the R for Data Science textbook, an emphasis was placed on understanding how to summarize and arrange data to make meaningful charts with ggplot2, tidyr, dplyr, and other tools in the tidyverse ecosystem.

Here is the link to the [Tidy Tuesday repository](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday)

In the words of the Tidy Tuesday project, "the intent of Tidy Tuesday is to provide a safe and supportive forum for individuals to practice their wrangling and data visualization skills independent of drawing conclusions. While we understand that the two are related, the focus of this practice is purely on building skills with real-world data." We encourage you to check out this repository and explore the datasets available to further enhance your data analysis skills.
